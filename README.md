## Overview

The **nurserysurveyrap** package is a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) for processing UK nursery survey data on improved stock sales. It generates official statistics on genetically improved Sitka spruce and Scots pine sales, supporting forest policy development and industry monitoring.

### Key Features

ðŸŒ² **Species Coverage**: Sitka spruce and Scots pine genetically improved stock  
ðŸ“Š **Geographic Scope**: Scotland and Great Britain totals  
ðŸ”„ **Data Processing**: Automated disaggregation error correction  
ðŸ“ˆ **Publication Outputs**: Word documents and accessible Excel workbooks  
âœ… **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and error checking  

## Survey Background

Every planting year (October to September), Forest Research conducts a voluntary survey of nursery businesses in Great Britain to monitor sales of improved nursery stock. This survey is run on behalf of Scottish Forestry and provides critical data for:

- **Forest Policy**: Informing decisions on genetic improvement programs
- **Industry Monitoring**: Tracking adoption of improved forestry stock
- **Research Planning**: Supporting breeding and improvement research
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding supply chains for quality stock

### Data Collected

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Species** | Sitka spruce, Scots pine |
| **Stock Types** | Genetically improved (GI) vs. non-improved |
| **Production Methods** | Seedlings, transplants, cuttings |
| **Geography** | Scotland, England & Wales, Great Britain totals |
| **Time Period** | Annual data by planting year (Oct-Sep) |

## Installation

### Development Version

```r
# Install from GitHub
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestresearch/nurserysurveyrap")
```

### Dependencies

The package requires several specialized dependencies:

```r
# Core data processing
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "readxl", "afcharts"))

# Forest Research specific packages
devtools::install_github("forestresearch/frpubutils")
devtools::install_github("forestresearch/afcharts")

# Publication formatting
install.packages(c("flextable", "officer", "aftables"))
```

### Network Installation

Some users may not be able to use `devtools::install_github()` due to network security settings. In this case:

```r
# Download zip file from GitHub and install locally
devtools::install_local("path/to/nurserysurveyrap.zip")
```

## Quick Start

### Single Function Pipeline

The entire analysis pipeline can be triggered with one function call:

```r
library(nurserysurveyrap)

# Generate 2024 nursery survey publication
output_nursery(
  dir_path = "Z:/IFOS/Statistics/Data/Nursery Survey/2022-23/4_Surveys returned",
  hist_data = "Z:/IFOS/Statistics/Data/Nursery Survey/nursery_survey-2023-10-15.rds",
  nursery_names = "Z:/IFOS/Statistics/Data/Nursery Survey/names.csv",
  ref_year = 2024,
  out_path = "Z:/IFOS/Statistics/Data/Nursery Survey",
  out_name_doc = "nursery-survey",
  pub_date = "2024-10-17",
  next_update = "2025-11-16",
  stat_name = "Daniel Braby"
)
```

### Step-by-Step Processing

For development or troubleshooting, you can run individual steps:

```r
# 1. Read all survey returns
returns <- read_returns("path/to/survey_returns/")

# 2. Load nursery name reference data
nursery_names <- read_nursery_names("path/to/nursery_names.csv")

# 3. Apply corrections and standardized names
corrected_returns <- fix_returns(returns, nursery_names)

# 4. Quality assurance check
message <- check_returns(corrected_returns)
print(message)

# 5. Load historical data and combine
historical_data <- readr::read_rds("path/to/historical_data.rds")
combined_data <- dplyr::bind_rows(corrected_returns, historical_data)
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Reading
- **Input**: Excel workbooks (.xlsx) with "return" sheets
- **Process**: Recursive search of specified directory
- **Output**: Combined tibble of all survey returns

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Disaggregation correction**: Fixes cases where Scotland totals exceed GB totals
- **Name standardization**: Applies consistent nursery names across years
- **Data validation**: Ensures proper data types and ranges

### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Error detection**: Identifies negative volumes (indicates corrections made)
- **Consistency checks**: Validates data integrity across time series
- **Manual review prompts**: Alerts users to cases requiring attention

### 4. Analysis & Reporting
- **Time series construction**: Combines new data with historical backseries
- **Statistical calculations**: Generates volume totals and improvement percentages
- **Publication formatting**: Creates tables meeting accessibility standards

## Disaggregation Error Correction

A key feature of the pipeline is automatic correction of disaggregation errors:

### The Problem
Nurseries sometimes report Scotland figures that don't properly disaggregate from their Great Britain totals, resulting in negative "England & Wales" values.

### The Solution
```r
# Automatic correction algorithm:
# 1. Identify negative E&W non-GI volumes
# 2. Calculate correction amount
# 3. Redistribute between GI and non-GI categories
# 4. Maintain overall volume totals
```

### Quality Check
```r
# After processing, check for corrections
check_returns(processed_data)
# Returns: "A disaggregation error has been corrected..." or "All is well."
```

## Output Structure
