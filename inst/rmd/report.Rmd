# Introduction

This publication provides estimates of sales of improved nursery stock by nurseries in Great Britain each planting year (October to September). The data cover sales of Sitka spruce and Scots pine to public and private sector clients in Scotland. Sales of these species in Great Britain are also reported.

The data in this release have been obtained from a voluntary survey of nursery businesses in Great Britain, run on behalf of Scottish Forestry, to monitor the level of improved nursery stock.

"Improved nursery stock" refers to genetically improved Sitka spruce and Scots pine stock raised from seed of seed orchard origin and by vegetative propagation of parent material derived from controlled crosses. These trees are predicted to grow faster and produce better timber than unimproved stock.

Data for the planting year October `r (ref_year - 2)` to September `r (ref_year - 1)` are published for the first time in this release. Data for earlier years are unchanged from those previously released. For further details, see [Forest Research's revisions policy](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/about-our-statistics/code-of-practice/quality-of-official-statistics/).

# Key findings

-   A total of `r all_scotland_im_n` million plants (`r paste0(all_scotland_im_pct, "%")`) derived from improved nursery stock were sold to Scotland in `r latest_year`.

-   Of all sales in Great Britain in `r latest_year`, `r all_gb_im_n` million plants (`r paste0(all_gb_im_pct, "%")`) were derived from improved nursery stock, `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(all_gb_im_ac)` (or `r all_gb_diff` million plants) compared with the previous year.

# Sales of nursery stock to Scotland

An estimated total of `r all_scotland_n` million Sitka spruce and Scots pine plants were sold to Scotland in `r latest_year` (Table 1), comprising `r scotland_sitka_n` million Sitka spruce plants and `r scotland_scots_n` million Scots pine plants. This represents `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(scotland_sitka_pct)` in sales of Sitka spruce and `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(scotland_scots_pct)` in sales of Scots pine from the previous year.

# Sales of nursery stock in Great Britain

Figure 2 shows the total sales for all improved stock sold in Great Britain, from  `r first_year` to `r latest_year`. Since the 2005/06 planting season, improved Sitka spruce seedlings have reported more than a two-fold increase in sales. Sales of improved Sitka spruce VP and improved Scots pine seedlings have both remained relatively constant throughout.

## Annex

## Introduction

This annex provides background information on the nursery survey statistics presented in this release. It covers the data sources and methodology used to produce the statistics, information on quality measures and on any revisions to historic data and links to further information.

## Glossary

### Conifers 

Trees with needles and cones, such as spruce, pine and larch.

### Great Britain (GB)
England, Scotland and Wales. 

### Improved nursery stock 

Genetically improved Sitka spruce and Scots pine stock raised from seed of seed orchard origin and by vegetative propagation of parent material derived from controlled crosses. Further detailed information is provided on page 6 of this release.

### Planting year

Twelve month period running from 1st October to 30th September.

### Scots pine

Species of coniferous tree, native to Great Britain.

### Seed orchard

Orchard where trees are grown for seed production rather than timber.

### Seedling

Young tree grown from seed, prior to being transplanted or planted out in the forest.

### Sitka spruce

Species of coniferous tree, not native to Great Britain.

### Vegetative propagation (VP)

Reproduction by cuttings, layering or grafting and not involving fertilisation.

## Data sources and methodology

The figures in this release have been obtained from a voluntary survey of nursery businesses in Great Britain, run on behalf of Scottish Forestry. The survey was set up to monitor the level of use of improved nursery stock in Scotland annually.

The results relate to respondents only; no estimates have been made for non-respondents to the survey or for businesses not covered by the survey. It is estimated that the respondents in 2012/13 have accounted for around 90% of all sales of Sitka spruce and Scots pine, whilst respondents in other years have accounted for around 95-100% of total sales.

## Quality

For the `r latest_year` survey, questionnaires were issued to a total of 14 nurseries (including one Forestry England and one Forestry and Land Scotland nursery). A total of 13 responses were received, giving a response rate of 100%.

Further information on the quality of our statistics can be found in our [ quality report](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/about-our-statistics/quality-of-official-statistics/).

\newpage

## Revisions

Figures for the planting year `r latest_year` are published for the first time in this release.

Our [ revisions policy](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/about-our-statistics/code-of-practice/quality-of-official-statistics/) sets out how revisions and errors to Forest Research statistics are dealt with.

## Further information

The assistance of the Confederation of Forest Industries (Confor) and the nursery trade in the running of this survey and the provision of data are gratefully acknowledged.

Figures in tables have been independently rounded, so may not add to the totals shown.

## Release schedule
