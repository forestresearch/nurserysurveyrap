# Introduction

This publication provides estimates of sales of improved nursery stock by nurseries in Great Britain each planting year (October to September). The data cover sales of Sitka spruce and Scots pine to public and private sector clients in Scotland. Sales of these species in Great Britain are also reported.

The data in this release have been obtained from a voluntary survey of nursery businesses in Great Britain, run on behalf of Scottish Forestry, to monitor the level of improved nursery stock.

"Improved nursery stock" refers to genetically improved Sitka spruce and Scots pine stock raised from seed of seed orchard origin and by vegetative propagation of parent material derived from controlled crosses. These trees are predicted to grow faster and produce better timber than unimproved stock.

Data for the planting year October `r (ref_year - 2)` to September `r (ref_year - 1)` are published for the first time in this release. Data for earlier years are unchanged from those previously released.

# Key findings

-   A total of `r all_scotland_im_n` million plants (`r paste0(all_scotland_im_pct, " %")`) derived from improved nursery stock were sold to Scotland in `r latest_year`.

-   Of all sales in Great Britain in `r latest_year`, `r all_gb_im_n` million plants (`r paste0(all_gb_im_pct, "%")`) were derived from improved nursery stock, `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(all_gb_im_ac)` (or `r all_gb_diff` million plants) compared with the previous year.

# Sales of nursery stock to Scotland

An estimated total of `r all_scotland_n` million Sitka spruce and Scots pine plants were sold to Scotland in `r latest_year` (Table 1), comprising `r scotland_sitka_n` million Sitka spruce plants and `r scotland_scots_n` million Scots pine plants. This represents `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(scotland_sitka_pct)` in sales of Sitka spruce and `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(scotland_scots_pct)` in sales of Scots pine from the previous year.

A total of `r all_scotland_im_n` million plants (`r paste0(all_scotland_im_pct, " %")`) derived from improved nursery stock were sold to Scotland in `r latest_year`, `r frpubutils::perc_chg_text(all_scotland_im_ac)` compared with `r previous_year`.
