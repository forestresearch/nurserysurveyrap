\title{Convert Date to Planting Year Interval}
\usage{
in_planting_year(date)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Date object or character string (YYYY-MM-DD) representing the date
to convert to a planting year interval.}
}
\value{
A lubridate interval object representing the planting year period.
}
\description{
Converts a specific date to its corresponding planting year interval. Planting
years in UK forestry run from 1st October to 30th September the following year,
aligning with the natural planting season cycle.
}
\details{
The UK forestry planting year convention:
\itemize{
  \item **Start**: 1st October
  \item **End**: 30th September (following year)
  \item **Example**: 2023/24 planting year runs from 1 Oct 2023 to 30 Sep 2024
}

Date assignment logic:
\itemize{
  \item Dates from January-September belong to the planting year ending that year
  \item Dates from October-December belong to the planting year ending the following year
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Date in winter (planting season)
winter_date <- as.Date("2024-01-15")
planting_interval <- in_planting_year(winter_date)
# Returns interval from 1 Oct 2023 to 30 Sep 2024

# Date in autumn (start of new planting year)
autumn_date <- as.Date("2024-11-01")
planting_interval <- in_planting_year(autumn_date)
# Returns interval from 1 Oct 2024 to 30 Sep 2025
}
