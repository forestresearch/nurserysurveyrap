\title{Fix Nursery Survey Disaggregation Errors}
\usage{
fix_returns(raw_returns, nursery_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_returns}{Tibble. Raw nursery survey data as output from \code{\link{read_returns}}.
Must contain columns for volume, country_sold_to, gi, nursery_ref, tree_sp,
prod_method, year, and nursery_name.}

\item{nursery_names}{Tibble. Standardized nursery names data as output from
\code{\link{read_nursery_names}}. Must contain nursery_ref and corrected nursery_name columns.}
}
\value{
A tibble with corrected nursery survey data containing:
\itemize{
  \item All original columns except nursery_name is replaced with standardized version
  \item \code{volume} values corrected for disaggregation errors
  \item May contain some negative volumes if errors were detected and corrected
}
}
\description{
Corrects disaggregation errors in nursery survey returns and applies standardised
nursery names. Disaggregation errors occur when nurseries report Scotland figures
that don't properly aggregate with their Great Britain totals, typically resulting
in negative "England & Wales" values.
}
\details{
The disaggregation error correction algorithm:
\itemize{
  \item **Identifies errors**: Finds negative volumes in "England & Wales" non-GI stock
  \item **Calculates correction**: Uses the magnitude of the negative value
  \item **Applies correction**: Redistributes volume between GI and non-GI categories
  \item **Maintains totals**: Ensures overall volumes remain consistent
}

The correction logic:
\enumerate{
  \item Find the disaggregation amount (negative "E&W" non-GI volume)
  \item Add this amount to "E&W" non-GI stock (making it zero or positive)
  \item Subtract this amount from "E&W" GI stock
  \item Apply corresponding corrections to Scotland figures
}

Name standardization:
\itemize{
  \item Removes original nursery_name from survey returns
  \item Joins with standardized names using nursery_ref
  \item Ensures consistent naming across years and surveys
}
}

\dontrun{
# Fix disaggregation errors in raw returns
raw_data <- read_returns("data/nursery_returns/")
nursery_names <- read_nursery_names("data/nursery_names.csv")

corrected_data <- fix_returns(raw_data, nursery_names)

# Check for any corrections made
check_returns(corrected_data)
}
