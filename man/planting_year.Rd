\title{Convert Year to Planting Year Text Format}
\usage{
planting_year(year)
}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Numeric. The starting year of the planting season. The planting
year will run from October of this year to September of the following year.}
}
\value{
Character string in planting year format "YYYY/YY".
}
\description{
Converts a calendar year to the standard planting year text format used in
UK forestry statistics. The planting year format shows both the starting and
ending years of the planting season (e.g., "2023/24").
}
\details{
The function creates the standard format used in forestry publications:
\itemize{
  \item **Format**: "YYYY/YY" (full start year, last two digits of end year)
  \item **Example**: Input 2023 produces "2023/24"
  \item **Coverage**: October 2023 to September 2024
}

This format is consistent with:
\itemize{
  \item Official forestry statistics publications
  \item Nursery survey reporting periods
  \item UK government statistical standards
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Convert years to planting year format
planting_year(2023)  # Returns "2023/24"
planting_year(2024)  # Returns "2024/25"

# Use in vectorized operations
years <- c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023)
sapply(years, planting_year)
# Returns c("2020/21", "2021/22", "2022/23", "2023/24")
}
