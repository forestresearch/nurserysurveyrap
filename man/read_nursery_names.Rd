\title{Read Standardized Nursery Names}
\usage{
read_nursery_names(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character. File path to the CSV file containing nursery reference data.
Expected to have columns: nursery_ref, nursery_name.}
}
\value{
A tibble with standardized nursery reference data containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{nursery_ref} - Integer, nursery reference number
  \item \code{nursery_name} - Character, standardized nursery name
  \item Additional columns if present in the CSV file
}
}
\description{
Reads a CSV file containing standardised nursery names and reference numbers.
This reference data ensures consistent nursery naming across survey years and
corrects for variations in how nurseries report their names.
}
\details{
The nursery names file serves as a master reference for:
\itemize{
  \item **Consistency**: Standardises nursery names across multiple survey years
  \item **Correction**: Handles variations in self-reported nursery names
  \item **Reference**: Links nursery_ref numbers to official names
  \item **Quality**: Ensures data integrity in time series analysis
}

Expected CSV structure:
\itemize{
  \item \code{nursery_ref} - Integer, unique nursery reference number
  \item \code{nursery_name} - Character, standardized nursery name
  \item No header requirements beyond these core columns
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read nursery names reference data
nursery_names <- read_nursery_names("data/nursery_names.csv")

# View the structure
head(nursery_names)
table(nursery_names$nursery_ref)
}
